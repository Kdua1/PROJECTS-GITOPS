6. Kubenetes(Kops)
7. Docker

Concepts: Gitops and CI/CD, IAC

Github will be use as a code hosting platform for others to work on the project from anywhere.
Argocd will be use as an open-source gitops continuous delivery tool and monitors the cluster.
Github Action will be use as CI/CD platform that allows us to automate deployment pipeline.
Git will be use as distributed version control tool for source code management and also for tracking changes.
AWS as our cloud provider
Kops will be use as our container managment platform.
Docker will be use as our containalization tool.
Helm will be use to automates the creation and deployment of kops application by combining the configuration files into a single reusable package.
Terraform as our provisioning tool.

This are the steps for the project.

Step 1

* Create a Github repo
* Clone the repo
* Generate the terraform configuration

Step 2

* Create the directory and files in your clone repo
 - .github/workflows
     create_ cluster.yaml
 - Terraform 
    Provider.tf
    variable.tf
    main.tf

 Write some content in the README.md file.
